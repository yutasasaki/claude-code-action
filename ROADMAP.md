# Claude Code GitHub Action Roadmap

Thank you for trying out the beta of our GitHub Action! This document outlines our path to `v1.0`. Items are not necessarily in priority order.

## Path to 1.0

- **Ability to see GitHub Action CI results** - This will enable Claude to look at CI failures and make updates to PRs to fix test failures, lint errors, and the like.
- **Cross-repo support** - Enable Claude to work across multiple repositories in a single session
- **Ability to modify workflow files** - Let Claude update GitHub Actions workflows and other CI configuration files
- **Support for workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch events** - Dispatch Claude on events triggered via API from other workflows or from other services
- **Ability to disable commit signing** - Option to turn off GPG signing for environments where it's not required. This will enable Claude to use normal `git` bash commands for committing. This will likely become the default behavior once added.
- **Better code review behavior** - Support inline comments on specific lines, provide higher quality reviews with more actionable feedback
- **Support triggering @claude from bot users** - Allow automation and bot accounts to invoke Claude
- **Customizable base prompts** - Full control over Claude's initial context with template variables like `$PR_COMMENTS`, `$PR_FILES`, etc. Users can replace our default prompt entirely while still accessing key contextual data
